                <p>Data Policy in general and that from the polar region is precious in particular. The true value of
                    scientific data is often realized long after it has been collected, and to ensure the lasting legacy
                    it is essential to ensure long-term preservation and sustained access to Antarctic data.</p>

                <p>Being the member of the Antarctic treaty, the data policy of <span style="color: #0a6ebd;">ESSO-NCPOR
                        (erstwhile NCAOR)</span> is governed by <strong>section III.1.c of the Antarctic Treaty 1959 and
                        has been broadly adopted from IPY 2012-13</strong> <a

                    view the interests of national and international scientific community.</p>

                <p>All data generated during the voyage and/ or from the Antarctic continent under the aegis of Indian
                    Scientific Expeditions accompanied by a full set of metadata that completely documents and describe
                    the data is to be given to ESSO-NCPOR (erstwhile NCAOR)for secured archival in the National Polar
                    Data Centre, on return to mainland.</p>

                <p>In order to promote the data management within the Antarctic scientific community in accordance to
                    the spirit of the Antarctic Treaty, the metadata (data about data) will be made available through
                    ESSO-NCPOR (erstwhile NCAOR) website without any access restrictions and will be shared on the
                    network established by the SC DAM – Standing Committee on Antarctic Data Management of the
                    Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research/Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs
                    (SCAR/COMNAP). However, the data will be treated as intellectual property of the owner / collector
                    with a lock-in period of 2 years from the date marking the end of the expedition season. This gives
                    ample opportunity to the collector for digesting the data, making full use of the information and in
                    translating it to knowledge base. The mandatory lock-in period upon request is extendable to a
                    maximum of five years depending on the nature, volume, sensitivity and reasonability of processing
                    time required.</p>

                <p>Upon the expiry of the mandatory or extended lock-in period, the data will be made available to the
                    scientific community for free and open access with a rider that the name of the owner / collector
                    will be duly acknowledged in any sort of technical report/ publications / short note / scientific
                    and or administrative communiqué.</p>

                <p>As per the <span style="color: #0a6ebd;">IPY</span> norms, the only exceptions to this policy of
                    full, free, and open access are:</p>

                        compromised</p>

                    <p>Where data release may cause harm, specific aspects of the data may need to be kept protected
